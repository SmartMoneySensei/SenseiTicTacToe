This project is based around a game i've played my entire life.... Tic-Tac-Toe.

The object of this game is to align either "x" or "o" 3 times without disconnecting using only 9 tiles.

Example:

WINNER = "xxx" or "ooo" can be connected vertically, horizontally, & diagnolly.

LOSER = is the person who was not able to connect "x" or "o" before the other person.

TIE = Only occurs when all 9 tiles are filled without a 3 straight connection. ( Ex. "OXO", "OOX", "XXO", or "XOX").
